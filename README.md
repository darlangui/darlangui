Hey there!! I am Darlan :wave:😊

I'm a developer with experience in JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin/Java, PHP (with Laravel), and Rust, working on both Front-end and Back-end development. I work with frameworks like Vue and React, and I also build cross-platform desktop applications using Tauri.

For mobile development, I create native Android apps with Kotlin in Android Studio. On the Back-end, I develop robust and efficient APIs using Rust, Java/Kotlin, and PHP with Laravel. Additionally, I have experience deploying and managing services on VPS, ensuring secure and scalable configurations.

I'm always looking for new challenges to enhance my skills and build innovative solutions. 🚀
